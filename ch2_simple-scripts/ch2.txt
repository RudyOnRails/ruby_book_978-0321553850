ruby -w will turn on warnings when running scripts from the CLI

default levels of warnings is 1
no warnings is -W0 and you can change level using -W#

to directly execute a script:
at CLI, type "which ruby" to get version, must know this in order to add to the Ruby script shebang line

make sure to use the path from "which ruby" so that you use the RVM ruby in your shebang line

chmod the file "chmod +x script_name.rb" to give it executable status

run script from CLI by prepending "./" to the script name which means run in this directory, that script

puts is put string
print does not add newline
p is used for dumping variable values

gets, get string, takes in what user types in using standard input

comments start with #
can also end a line # with a comment

Ruby does not support multi-line comments using /* */ like most languages,
instead it uses =being and =end as delimiters
